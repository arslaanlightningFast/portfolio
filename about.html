<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from
Lovely Professional University (LPU).

Along with my academic journey, I actively work in the fields of
software testing and web development. I have experience in testing
applications to ensure functionality, reliability, and performance,
as well as designing and developing responsive websites.

I am eager to learn new technologies, improve my technical skills,
and grow as a software professional in the IT industry.
